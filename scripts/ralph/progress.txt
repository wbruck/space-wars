## Codebase Patterns
- The confirm move button in Board.svelte uses visibility toggling (not conditional rendering) to prevent layout shift
- Board.svelte renders UI below the SVG board; layout stability requires fixed-height slots for conditionally visible elements
- All Svelte components use Svelte 5 runes syntax ($props, $derived, $state, $effect)
- Direction arrows and selection happen inside the SVG (no layout impact); the confirm button is outside the SVG (causes layout impact if conditionally rendered)
- CombatScreen.svelte: outcome text (.roll-result, .target-label) is rendered in a fixed-height `.outcome-area` below target buttons, NOT in the dice area within the ships-container flex row
- CombatScreen.svelte uses a `tick` state counter incremented after engine mutations to force reactive updates for derived state from mutable combat engine

## 2026-02-14 - US-037
- Replaced conditional rendering (`{#if}`) of the confirm move button with a fixed-height `.confirm-btn-slot` wrapper that uses `visibility: hidden` to hide the button while preserving layout space
- Added `disabled` attribute to the button when hidden to prevent interaction
- Added `.confirm-btn-slot` CSS class with `min-height: 60px` and flex centering
- Added `.confirm-btn.hidden` CSS class with `visibility: hidden`
- Files changed: `src/lib/components/Board.svelte`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The confirm button was the only element outside the SVG in Board.svelte that was conditionally rendered — direction arrows are inside the SVG and don't affect page layout
  - Use `visibility: hidden` + `disabled` pattern (not `display: none` or `{#if}`) for UI elements that appear/disappear to prevent layout shifts
  - No browser testing tools were available; manual browser verification recommended

## 2026-02-14 - US-038
- Moved attack outcome text (hit/miss/destroyed messages and target-label) from the `.dice-area` inside `.ships-container` to a new `.outcome-area` div below the `.target-buttons` section
- The `.outcome-area` has `min-height: 2rem` to reserve fixed vertical space, preventing layout shift when text appears/disappears
- Player health panel, dice display, and enemy health panel now remain in stable positions throughout combat since the dice-area column height no longer changes
- Files changed: `src/lib/components/CombatScreen.svelte`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The dice-area flex column in the ships-container was the layout shift culprit — adding children (outcome text) to it changed its height and pushed the ship panels
  - Moving conditionally rendered text to a separate fixed-height area below the main layout is the cleanest fix for this class of layout shift
  - CombatScreen is self-contained (no props from App.svelte), all data comes from stores
  - No browser testing tools were available; manual browser verification recommended
