# Ralph Progress Log
Started: Thu Feb 13 20:24:00 CST 2026

## Codebase Patterns
- BoardObject class hierarchy: BoardObject → Obstacle/PowerUp (and new subclasses BlackHole, Enemy)
- Subclasses override `this.type` and `this.id` in constructor after calling super()
- `createBoardObject` factory uses a switch on type string to instantiate the correct class
- Tests use `makeRng(seed)` (xorshift32) for deterministic randomness
- The `ralph/board-objects` branch has all game code; `main` only has ralph scripts

## 2026-02-13 20:24 - US-022
- Implemented BlackHole class extending Obstacle in src/lib/game/boardObjects.js
- Constructor sets type='blackhole', id='blackhole:'+vertexId
- onPlayerInteraction() returns { killed: true, cause: 'blackhole' }
- Updated createBoardObject factory to handle 'blackhole' type
- Added 7 unit tests for BlackHole (type, value, vertexId, onPlayerInteraction, instanceof, getAffectedVertices, factory)
- Files changed: src/lib/game/boardObjects.js, src/lib/game/boardObjects.test.js
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Branch ralph/board-objects is the parent branch with all game code, not main
  - BlackHole inherits from Obstacle but overrides type and id after super() call
  - BlackHoles should NOT be in obstacleSet (they don't block movement)
